        <h1>The Scream</h1>

        <p id="ResumoObra">The Scream The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name<br>
            given to each of four versions of a composition, created<br>
            as both paintings and pastels, by Norwegian<br>
            Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and<br>
            1910. The German title Munch gave these works is Der<br>
            Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works<br>
            show a figure with an agonized expression against a<br>
            andscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow<br>
            has described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a<br>
            Mona Lisa for our time"<br>
            Edvard Munch created the four versions in various<br>
            media. The National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, holds one<br>
            of two painted versions (1893, shown here). The Munch<br>
            Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see<br>
            gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893.
